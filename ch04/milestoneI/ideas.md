# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

To start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is much easier to scale something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or another kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below, you should have a basic description of a program idea and a few sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Adventure Game

A game where the user makes different choices that can lead to different outcomes. For instance, if the user chose to go left, they would go to the cafeteria; if they chose to go right, they would go to the gym.

## Space Invaders Game

The player controls the ship at the bottom of the screen, which can move only horizontally. The aliens moves both horizontally and vertically (approaching the ship). The ship can be controlled to shoot laser to destroy the aliens, while the aliens will randomly shoot towards the ship.

## Simulation Game
Maybe a simulation or a remake of some type of game. I'm still not sure as what I can do for this but maybe like a simulation of a room in real life or something.
