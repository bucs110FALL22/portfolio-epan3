# Write the following functions:
# Write a function that multiplies two numbers together using a loop and accumulator (no multiplication) and return the resulting value


# Write a function that takes a number and exponent as parameters and raises the number to the exponent and return the resulting value (no exponentiation)


# Write another function, called square, that takes a single parameter and squares it by only calling your multiplication function and return the resulting value
# Test your code by calling each function with whatever value you choose, then printing their results, i.e. the return value.
