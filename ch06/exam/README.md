# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(Drawing a circular icon with the letter E inside to represent the first letter of my name & I will also be going for a night theme for instance: stars, fireworks, clouds, etc.)*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(Not sure if there are any (there potentially may be but does not show on display so I'm not really sure))*

## REFERENCES *(I used the Turtle Library Documentation as a reference, and I also used the full-screen code from Stack Overflow so that the turtle screen stays full screen)*
Turtle Library Documetation: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html]

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(drawing.py is my main drawing, but I also tried doing another drawing on some other repl, but I could not integrate it as the screensize was different (I have more return functions there please let me know if you want to see it)))*
Here is the link to the other drawing I did with better return functions: [https://replit.com/join/zcfkdobqsb-ericpan7]
