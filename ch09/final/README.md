# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(This Python program generates a random activity and number fact using the BoredAPI and NumbersAPI. The user can input the number of participants and price/cost range for the activity, and the program will generate a random activity based on the user's input. The user can also input a number, and the program will generate a random number fact based on that number. The program will then combine the data from both APIs into a formatted string and display it on the screen.)*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(If you enter a random character or string it will show an error message in shell.)*

## REFERENCES *(https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(Sometimes when the user enters input it may say "Activity Does Not Exist. Try Again". This is because there might not be an activity with the combination of participants and cost value. So, I would suggest using a combo with a cost value of 0, which usually works most of the time.)*
