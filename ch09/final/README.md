# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(I use BoredAPI to generate a random activity based on user input. I ask the user to enter the desired amount of people for the activity (ranging from 0 to n), and the price/cost range from (inclusive 0 to exclusive 1). Afterwards the shell displays a formatted string display of the activity. Afterwards, I use NumbersAPI to generate a random number fact based on their chosen number. I ask the user to input a number. After that I take the input and format it as a string to display in the shell.*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(If you enter a random character it will show an error message in shell)*

## REFERENCES *(https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(Sometimes when you enter input it may say "Activity Does Not Exist. Try Again." since there might not be that combination of partipants and cost for that certain activity. A combo with cost value of 0 usually works most of the times.)*
